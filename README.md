# RMP-UM-Flint
A Chrome extension for viewing professor ratings on class registration pages.

## Usage
Download the source and unzip. Navigate to chrome://extensions, click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped source folder. Chrome will then load the extension.
The extension will be clickable only when you're on a class registration page. Highlight a professor's name, click the extension, and the ratings will be displayed.
Note: This extension uses RateMyProfessor's internal API, so they will probably block you after a while.
